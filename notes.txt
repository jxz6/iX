inprogress.html and explore.html difference?
should have login and logout, otherwise cannot personalize recommendations

request.form.get(xxx) xxx should be tag's "name"

html:form = py:preference
html:tickets = py:showings

redirect's data is for lists or chosen -> all changed to save in session (otherwise shows in query string)
render_template's data is for html

tmp use redirect with param
see if session messed up then change to pass param (like retrieve_user)

for errors, in html:
{% if error %}
    <p class="error"><strong> Error: </strong> {{ error }}
{% endif %}

session variables are changed to string

tmp db return type: dict
tmp passing between funcs: list
